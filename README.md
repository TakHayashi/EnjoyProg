## Number Place solvers, neural NW and test codes for programming topics.  
### Description  
 1.Number place solver programs I wrote for years.  
   Execution time improvement in Python version.  
   One Python simple version is ported to 8 languages:  
   C, C#, JS, Julia, Ruby, Lisp1.5, Scheme(now Racket), Haskell.   
   Refer 'solver' folder.
  
 2.Try Neural NW to confirm training and prediction.  
   in TryAI folder.
  
 3.Test codes for programming topics.
